    Add onion, areas of code, and demographics studies to the file aliases.json.
    This is needed to keep this file updated with the aliases we use in the
    dashboards by adding them to the appropiate data sources.

    The included aliases:
    - all_onion
    - git_areas_of_code
    - demographics
